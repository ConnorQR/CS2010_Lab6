CS2010 Lab Assignment 6

The program is supposed to simulate memory However I never finished it so it simulates code that fails

to build it enter gcc -o Prog1 Prog1_Files Prog1.cpp in the terminal
to run it enter ./Prog1 in the terminal
(I have no idea how to run these files in Ubuntu)

I never got around to writing the code for creating the freelist or allocated list. I also never wrote the code for creating the code to when it checks the leaseexpiry. I never did the main part of taking chucks out of the free list to make space for the a new list that was created. However I did have everything set ready for that process to start I just never did that portion of the assignment
